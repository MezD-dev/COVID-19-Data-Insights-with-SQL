## 📊 **Key Insights & Findings**
### **1️⃣ Global COVID-19 Trends**
- The **global death rate** fluctuates between **1-5%** depending on the country and time period.
- The highest **infection rates** occurred in countries with **dense populations** or **limited healthcare access**.
- Countries with **higher testing capacity** reported **lower death rates**, indicating **better pandemic management**.

### **2️⃣ Country-Specific Analysis**
- **Top countries with the highest death toll**: USA, Brazil, India, and Russia.
- **Highest infection rates relative to population**: Countries like **Peru, Belgium, and Czechia** reported infection rates **above 10%** of their population.

### **3️⃣ Vaccination Impact**
- Countries that **vaccinated early and rapidly** saw a **significant decline in new deaths** after reaching a **50%+ vaccination rate**.
- **Rolling vaccination trends** show a **strong correlation** between higher vaccine adoption and **reduced mortality rates**.

## 🚀 **How to Use This Repository**
### **1️⃣ Running SQL Queries**
- Open `Covid19_SQL_Analysis.sql` in **MySQL Workbench**.
- Ensure the dataset (`CovidDeaths.xlsx` and `CovidVaccinations.xlsx`) is imported into **MySQL**.
- Execute the queries to analyze different COVID-19 trends.

### **2️⃣ Exploring the Tableau Dashboard**
- Open `Covid19_Dashboard.twbx` using **Tableau Desktop**.
- Interact with filters to explore country-specific trends.
- View **infection rates, deaths, and vaccination impact** visually.
